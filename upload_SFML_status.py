Description: 
This Python scripts connects to one or several Linux host and pulls the NVIDIA GPU monitoring status by the use of nvidia-smi.
It outputs it to a txt file which is then parsed into html with additional information. The html file is uploaded to a share
which acts as a WWW directory for a website. This makes it easy to montitor the GPU status of several machines without manually
connecting to them. It also adds monitoring for OS and kernel version, CPU, memory and disks.
